* ~stack-overflow-mode~ -- search Stack Overflow from Emacs

  Simple major mode for Emacs to allow for quickly searching stack
  overflow questions.

  Stack Overflowâ€™s home page is a bit too complicated to comfortably
  use from ~eww~ or other Emacs based web browsers. This mode allows
  you to quickly search based on some key words and view question in
  more detail in ~eww~ (or any other browser).
